ASSE-Smart-Meter-Application
============================
(19/11/2012)

My submission for an assignment to Bond University's "Application Software Security Engineering" subject. The assignment was to develop a 'smart meter' for electricity and to apply application security principles by securing against the [OWASP][1] top 20 vulnerablity list.

No documentation provided here, Java code only.
